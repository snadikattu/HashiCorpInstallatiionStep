HashiCorp provides a number of products, including Vagrant, Packer, Terraform, Vault, Consul, and Nomad. I'll provide a step-by-step guide on setting up Terraform, one of their most popular tools used for Infrastructure as Code (IaC). If you're interested in a different HashiCorp product, please let me know.

**Installing Terraform**

1. **Download Terraform**

   Visit the Terraform downloads page at https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html. Choose the package appropriate for your system. Terraform is distributed as a single binary. Download the package matching your operating system and architecture.

2. **Install Terraform**

   Unzip the package you downloaded. The result is a single binary program, `terraform`, which you can move to a directory in your `PATH`. Here's an example using `unzip` and `mv` on a Unix-like system:

   ```bash
   unzip terraform_1.x.x_OS_arch.zip
   mv terraform /usr/local/bin/
   ```

   Verify the installation by opening a new terminal session and checking that `terraform` is available:

   ```bash
   terraform -v
   ```

   If you've installed it correctly, it will print the version that you installed.

**Using Terraform**

1. **Set Up Your Provider**

   Terraform uses a plugin-based architecture to support hundreds of infrastructure and service providers. In most cases, you'll interact with these providers through a `provider` block in your Terraform configuration.

   Here's an example of how to set up the AWS provider:

   ```hcl
   provider "aws" {
     region = "us-west-2"
   }
   ```

2. **Define Your Infrastructure**

   Write a Terraform configuration file (with a `.tf` extension) to describe the infrastructure you want. Here's an example that sets up a single AWS EC2 instance:

   ```hcl
   resource "aws_instance" "example" {
     ami           = "ami-0c94855ba95c574c8"
     instance_type = "t2.micro"

     tags = {
       Name = "example-instance"
     }
   }
   ```

   Replace `"ami-0c94855ba95c574c8"` with the ID of the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) you want to use, and `"t2.micro"` with the type of instance you want to create.

3. **Initialize Your Terraform Workspace**

   In your terminal, navigate to the directory containing your Terraform configuration file, and initialize your Terraform workspace, which will download the provider plugins you need:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

4. **Apply Your Configuration**

   Apply your configuration to reach the desired state of your infrastructure:

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

   Terraform will print a plan of the changes it will make to your infrastructure, and prompt you for confirmation. Type `yes` to proceed.

Congratulations, you've installed Terraform and used it to manage your infrastructure!

For more complex setups, you may want to look into Terraform modules, which let you encapsulate parts of your infrastructure as reusable components. There's also Terraform Cloud, which provides collaboration and governance features for teams using Terraform.
